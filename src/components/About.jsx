            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Alex , a 19 yrs old student from Romania!</p>
            <p>I study at Romanian-American University in Bucharest , School of Computer Science for Business Management. 
            I started learning web development about 9 months ago and I loved it ever since. 
            I started not knowing anything and now I am getting closer and closer to learning React! 
            I really like making designs and starting to make them into a real website. 
            I would like to expand my knowledge of web development and to work in a company with real challenges to solve.</p>
